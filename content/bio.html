<p>I am a PhD student in Mathematics and Computer Science at the California Institute of Technology, where I work on the intersection of <span style="color: var(--link)">scientific machine learning and operator learning for physical systems</span>. My research focuses on developing principled methods that combine neural architectures with the mathematical structure of partial differential equations, aiming to improve how we model and understand complex physical phenomena.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my Master’s degree in Physics at ETH Zürich. During my studies, I worked at IBM Research on quantum simulation and scientific machine learning, and later joined Bloomberg as a data science intern, applying AI methods to large-scale financial data. These experiences shaped my fascination for how rigorous mathematical ideas can translate into powerful computational tools with real-world impact.

I’m broadly interested in <span style="color: var(--link)">scientific ML, quantum simulation, and computational modeling</span>. Outside of research, I love strength training and protein bars.</p>
