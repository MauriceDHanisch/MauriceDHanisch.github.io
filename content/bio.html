<p>I am a PhD student in Mathematics and Computer Science at the California Institute of Technology, where I work on the
    intersection of <span style="color: var(--link)">scientific machine learning and operator learning for physical
        systems</span>.

    Before starting my PhD, I completed my Master's degree in Physics at ETH Zürich. During my studies, I worked at IBM
    Research on quantum simulation and scientific machine learning, and later joined Bloomberg as a data science intern,
    applying AI methods to large-scale financial data. These experiences shaped my fascination for how rigorous
    mathematical ideas can translate into powerful computational tools with real-world impact.

    I'm broadly interested in <span style="color: var(--link)">scientific ML, quantum simulation, and computational
        modeling</span>.
