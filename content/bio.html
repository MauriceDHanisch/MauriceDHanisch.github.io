<p>I am a first-year PhD student in Math & CS at Caltech, working in 
    <a href="https://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/" target="_blank">Anima Anandkumar's AI + Science lab</a>. 
    I am grateful to be fully funded by the Kortschak fellowship.</p>

<p>My research focuses on <span style="color: var(--link)">ML for quantum systems</span> (chemistry &amp; material sciences), 
    and I am broadly interested in <span style="color: var(--link)">ML for quantum many-body systems</span> and 
    <span style="color: var(--link)">scientific machine learning</span>.</p>

<p>If you are a interested in the topics I work on, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
